This is a project I created with the purpose of taking images of cities at night and collecting data on light pollution, 
This project takes the pixel data of the images and models it into a histograam in order to show brightness levels of the image,
Images are stored in the /data folder and the program is run on the command line. all Images are scanned and coresponding results are sent into the /output folder.
These results include the .png files of the histograms as well as a .csv file containing data from all the images.
